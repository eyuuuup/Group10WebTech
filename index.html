        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p> We tested the HTML and CSS using two browsers, Firefox and Chrome. Testing the normal CSS stylesheet for screens
            usually accounted to just opening the webpage up in Chrome, and sometimes in Firefox. Testing CSS and HTML was, 
            in our opinion, very straightforward. We tested the Print stylesheet by step by step removal of features that would
            require a lot of ink, and then checking in Chrome or Firefox how the printer preview looked. To test the different screen 
            sizes we used Firefox, because that had a handy tool for developers which emulated different screen sizes. The big problem
            with smaller screen sizes was the tables we used, so we primarily checked how the tables looked on different screen sizes.
            As for the constructs, we didn't really find any noticable difference between the two, the browsers did have some different 
            styles, for example, font-weight, but nothing in the sense of functionality. Another difference is that the input type="number" is resized
            to fit a number in Chrome, but not in Firefox. We did notice that Firefox had no support for orphans and widows, but we weren't using 
            it now. In the future if it became a big part of the website, we probably need to make specific CSS to emulate the orphans and widows
            to make it work on Firefox.
