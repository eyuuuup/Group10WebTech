    <th>Principle 1: "Perceivable"</th>
    <tr>Guideline 1.1: Text-alternatives</tr>
    <td>The website offers text alternatives through adding dynamic coloring to the titles (e.g "Webshop" title) 
        and through brightening and coloring the text (e.g. the table headers and the text "Shopkeeper wants you to buy something") by "mouse hovering" command. 
        For further improvement, a braille alphabet option can be considered.</td>
