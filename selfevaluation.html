        <h2>High-level overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our website consists of only one page and not a lot of content, so in terms of accessibility and/or
            usability
            there is not much what can go wrong. It will thus be easier to adhere to the Accessibility Guidelines. Our
            page adheres to the text alternatives guidelines, and thus provides sufficient text alternatives for
            non-text content. It also properly conveys relationships between content, both visually and
            programmatically. Contrast in the page may be improved, but overall there is a stark difference between
            links and controls and normal text, users are able to separate foreground from background. The use of a
            keyboard to navigate the site works as well as using your mouse, but we need to highlight the current
            element more. Because the site is only one page and doesn’t a lot of content, it is inherently easier to
            navigate.

        <h2>Discussion of guidelines</h2>
        <p>
            Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives and Guidelines 1.3 Adaptable are the two most relevant for our page because
            we feel those two guidelines offer the most accessibility and/or usability if you implement the techniques
            needed. Other guidelines are either stuff that doesn’t really apply here because we don’t have a lot of
            content and multiple pages, or they don’t impact the accessibility and/or usability nearly as much as the
            two guidelines mentioned earlier if you implement them.

        <h2>Improvement list</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add :focus to :hover element, where relevant,  to make them work with keyboards.</li>
            <li>Move up the img element at the top to better represent the visual layout in the DOM.</li>
            <li>Add more comments and indentation to script.js.</li>
            <li>Add background and margin-bottom to CSS.</li>
            <li>Pass all the validator checks.</li>

                    code and as a label on the page itself. The buttons on the other hand, only have a name on the
                    website itself, and lack a name attribute in the code.

                    There is no non-text content to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a
                    computer, so there is no need for a text alternative.

                    We have non-text content that is used primarily for decorating the website itself. That content only
                    serves an aesthetic purpose, and provides no information or functionality. For example, the various
                    images we have, or the background image in the contact section. This content is properly addressed
                    as images or belonging to a stylesheet, so it can be ignored by assistive technology.

                    We’ve implemented techniques that take care of every point mentioned, and have observed no obvious
                    failures that would make this guideline fail, so we asses we passed the guideline for level A.

                <td>Info and Relationships</td>
                <td>
                    Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically
                    determined or are available in text, this is needed to pass this guideline. We seperate information
                    and structure from presentation, which can enable different presentations to be added in by
                    assistive technologies. We also deploy tables with proper table markup, so screen reader can
                    properly navigate the table. We are also differentiating relationships by using appropriate semantic
                    elements, for example, headers and paragraphs.

            <tr>
                <td>Meaningful Sequence</td>
                <td>
                    Important here is that the order of content presented to assistive technologies allows the user to
                    make sense of the content. Our website does that by placing every section of information in a
                    meaningful sequence. So, for example, we first have a header, then an image, and text after that,
                    not the other way around. We also make the DOM match the visual order, this will cause everyone to
                    read the content and interact it in the same order. For example, the navigation is visually above
                    the rest of the content, and in the DOM this is also the same. Although our logo is visually above
                    everything, it is under the first header in the DOM, so we need to fix that.

                <td>Sensory Characteristics</td>
                <td>
                    We don’t use any contents that rely solely on sensory characteristics, so there is no need to
                    provide additional instructions.

                    Again we implemented techniques that the guidelines mentioned, and have no obvious failure
                    techniques that would make this whole guideline fail. One element being on the wrong spot is a quick
                    fix, so we still asses we passed the guideline for level A.

                <td>
                    The use of color in our page is used for cosmetic purposes, conveying information, indicating an
                    action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element is always done in a way that
                    doesn’t require color as a means to use them. We also provide visual cues on focus for links or
                    controls so that users with low vision have a better time identifying them. One point of concern can
                    be the contrast between the background and our text color.

            <tr>
                <td>Conclusion</td>
                <td>
                    Use of color was the only thing we needed to think about to make this guideline pass, so being that
                    color is mostly cosmetic, we consider this also passed.

                <td>
                    All of our functionality of the content on our website is alose operable through a keyboard
                    interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. All event handlers can also
                    be triggered by using a keyboard. Every input element also has a label attached to it, which
                    assistive technology can use to operate interactive elements. Although we need to make clear which
                    element in currently in focus to really help the user.

                    keyboard interface.

                <td>Conclusion</td>
                <td>
                    We have one point of improvement which is pretty important, but it doesn’t completely hinder the use
                    of a keyboard. We still find that we need to pix that one point to pass this guideline.

                <td>
                    We only have 1 webpage, so there is no content that gets repeated on multiple web pages. Furthermore
                    the webpage we do have, doesn’t have a lot of content in the first place. We don't need a separate
                    mechanism for this guideline.

                    elements, placed in order as they appear in the table, and then we have the buttons that do
                    something with those inputs.
